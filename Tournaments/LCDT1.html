        <p><b><u><i>Other Requirements: This tournament mostly follows the USCF Laws of Chess, with two variations. The first variation is that scoresheets are required to be turned in to the arbiters after each game (these may be collected at the end of the tournament). The second variation is if an illegal move is made and not reported (both players notate the illegal move), both players lose the game, but if it is reported, the offending player loses the game. Violation of the touch-move rule counts as making an illegal move, as well as taking back a move (i.e. you let go of a knight and blundered, so you take back the knight move and move it to a different square).</b></u></i></p>
